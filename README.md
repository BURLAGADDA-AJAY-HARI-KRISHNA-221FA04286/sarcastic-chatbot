# Sarcastic Chatbot 🤖

Welcome to the **Sarcastic Chatbot** – a witty and entertaining conversational bot designed to add a spark of sarcasm and humor to your chats.  
This project combines modern web technologies with the **Gemini API** to deliver clever, humorous, and sometimes subtly mocking responses.  

---

## ✨ Features

- **Sarcastic Personality**: The bot is fine-tuned with a custom prompt to ensure it replies with humor and wit in every conversation.  
- **Simple UI**: Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean, minimalist design.  
- **Share Functionality**: Copy your entire chat history to the clipboard with one click and share your funniest conversations.  
- **Secure API Handling**: The backend (Next.js) securely handles all Gemini API requests, so your API key is never exposed.
